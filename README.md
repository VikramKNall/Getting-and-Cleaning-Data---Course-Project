# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data---Course-Project
This a course project which collects, cleans the data from accelerometers devices while performing different activities

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1.	Loads the activity and feature info
2.	Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping the values taken for mean and standard deviation
3.	Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
4.	Combines and merges the two datasets
5.	Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
6.	Creates a tidy dataset that is required


The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
